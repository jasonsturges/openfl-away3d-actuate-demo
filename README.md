# OpenFL Away3D Actuate Demo
3D tweening demo using OpenFL, Away3D, Actuate, and Haxe


# Getting started

This is a [Haxe](http://haxe.org/) project demonstrating tweening, built with [OpenFL](http://www.openfl.org/), [Away3D](http://away3d.com/), and [Actuate](https://github.com/openfl/actuate).

### Install Haxe

If you don't already have Haxe installed, start by [installing](http://haxe.org/download/) either Mac, Linux, or Windows packages.

### Library Dependencies

If this is your first time running haxelib, setup by executing the following command:

    $ haxelib setup

##### Install Lime

    $ haxelib install lime
    $ haxelib run lime setup
    
##### Install OpenFL

    $ haxelib install openfl
    $ haxelib run openfl setup
    
##### Install Actuate

    $ haxelib install actuate
    
##### Install Away3D

    $ haxelib install away3d

##### Troubleshooting

    $ haxelib upgrade


# Building and running
